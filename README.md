## How to use

Clone/download the repo

Open the config.js file in any text editor

Follow the instructions in the comments for the first 4 lines.

Run the script using `node path/to/run.js`


If you need to get your Discord token, press ctrl+shift+i and go to the console tab.

You can use this to output your token: (Credit to NotNexuss)

```javascript
(webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([[''],{},e=>{m=[];for(let c in e.c)m.push(e.c[c])}]),m).find(m=>m?.exports?.default?.getToken!==void 0).exports.default.getToken()
```
