# virtual-fisher-auto-fish thats broken because idk
This is an auto fisher for the Virtual Fisher Discord bot

This uses [Discord.js Selfbot](https://github.com/aiko-chan-ai/discord.js-selfbot-v13)

> [!CAUTION]
> This bot does get detected occasionally for automation by Virtual Fisher. You should also be careful using Discord self-bot as they are against Discord's TOS

## How to use

To use this, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed and run:
`npm install discord.js-selfbot-v13@latest`

Download the auto-fisher.js file and open it with a text editor.
Follow the instructions in the comments for the first lines.
Make sure to run the detection bypass if you want to avoid getting banned.

If you need to get your Discord token, press ctrl+shift+i and go to the console tab.

You can use this to output your token: (Credit to NotNexuss)

```javascript
(webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([[''],{},e=>{m=[];for(let c in e.c)m.push(e.c[c])}]),m).find(m=>m?.exports?.default?.getToken!==void 0).exports.default.getToken()
```
